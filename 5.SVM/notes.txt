1.Failed to use the "Estimate Posterior Probabilities"
  Mdl = fitcecoc(X,Y,'Coding','onevsall','Learners',t,'FitPosterior',1);
  Warning: Unable to fit posterior probabilities for learner 8 (SVM) because: Some classes
have one observation only. 

2.Cross Validation could not be implemented.
  Warning: One or more folds do not contain points from all the groups. 


3.Mdl = fitcecoc(X,Y,'Coding','onevsall','Learners','naivebayes');
  Warning: Unable to fit learner 1 (NaiveBayes) because: A normal distribution cannot be
fit for the combination of class -1 and predictor x124. The data has zero variance.
